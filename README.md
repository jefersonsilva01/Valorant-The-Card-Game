## About the project

You can also read a version of this readme in portuguese [here](https://github.com/jefersonsilva01/Valorant-The-Card-Game/blob/main/README-pt_BR.md).

The project aims to create a game based on the classic [top trumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Trumps) card game, where players use illustrated thematic cards and compare their attributes to find out who would win in each criterion, here in this case the theme used is that of the popular online game [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/), where the cards are based on their respective characters.

You can see the game demo by clicking [here](https://jefersonsilva01.github.io/Valorant-The-Card-Game/).

## Rules

<h4>GOAL</h4>

Win all the cards in the deck.

<h4>THE GAME</h4>

The game is based on comparing the values ​​of your card with those of the other player. For your card to win, the chosen characteristic must have a higher value than your opponent's card.
When your card wins, you win your opponent's card and the next card in your pile appears for a new turn.

<h4>SCOREBOARD</h4>

The scoreboard shows the number of cards you and your opponents have. The score changes automatically with each round.
In case of a tie, the cards are returned to the bottom of each player's pile and a new round begins.

<h4>HOW TO PLAY</h4>

1 To start, choose from the information on your card the one that you think has the value capable of beating your opponents' cards.

If you win - the other player's card will go to the back of your pile of cards and you continue choosing the information for your next card.
If the other player wins - his card will go behind his pile of cards and the turn to choose passes to him.
In case of a tie - the cards will go behind each player's pile and a new dispute is held, with the player who chose the cards that tied must choose again.

2 The game ends when one of the players wins all the cards in the deck
